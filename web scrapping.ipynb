      "The Problem\n",
      "The insurance industry, particularly in the context of providing coverage to Public Company Directors against Insider Trading public lawsuits, faces a significant challenge in accurately determining insurance premiums. Traditional methods of premium calculation may lack precision, and there is a growing need for more sophisticated and data-driven approaches. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models in predicting insurance premiums for this specialized coverage is essential to enhance accuracy, fairness, and responsiveness in adapting to evolving risk factors.\n",
      "The problem at hand involves developing robust AI and ML models that can effectively analyze a multitude of dynamic variables influencing the risk profile of Public Company Directors. These variables include market conditions, regulatory changes, historical legal precedents, financial performance of the insured company, and individual directorial behaviors. The goal is to create a predictive model that not only accurately assesses the risk associated with potential insider trading public lawsuits but also adapts in real-time to new information, ensuring that the insurance premiums charged by the global insurance firm are reflective of the current risk landscape.\n",

    "Organization Size: 10000+\n",
    "The Problem\n",
    "The insurance industry, particularly in the context of providing coverage to Public Company Directors against Insider Trading public lawsuits, faces a significant challenge in accurately determining insurance premiums. Traditional methods of premium calculation may lack precision, and there is a growing need for more sophisticated and data-driven approaches. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models in predicting insurance premiums for this specialized coverage is essential to enhance accuracy, fairness, and responsiveness in adapting to evolving risk factors.\n",
    "The problem at hand involves developing robust AI and ML models that can effectively analyze a multitude of dynamic variables influencing the risk profile of Public Company Directors. These variables include market conditions, regulatory changes, historical legal precedents, financial performance of the insured company, and individual directorial behaviors. The goal is to create a predictive model that not only accurately assesses the risk associated with potential insider trading public lawsuits but also adapts in real-time to new information, ensuring that the insurance premiums charged by the global insurance firm are reflective of the current risk landscape.\n",
    "Key Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Complexity: The relevant data for predicting insurance premiums in this context is multifaceted, involving financial data, legal precedents, market trends, and individual directorial histories. Integrating and interpreting this diverse set of data poses a significant challenge.\n",
    "Dynamic Risk Factors: The risk factors influencing insider trading public lawsuits are dynamic and subject to rapid changes. The models must be capable of adapting to evolving market conditions, legal landscapes, and individual company dynamics.\n",
    "Fairness and Ethics: Ensuring fairness in premium calculation is critical. The models should be designed to avoid biases and discriminatory practices, considering the diverse backgrounds and contexts of Public Company Directors.\n",
    "Regulatory Compliance: The insurance industry is subject to regulatory frameworks that vary across jurisdictions. The developed models need to comply with these regulations while providing accurate and reliable predictions.\n",
    "Interpretability: Transparency in model predictions is crucial, especially in an industry where decisions can have significant financial implications. Ensuring that the AI and ML models are interpretable and explainable is vital for gaining the trust of stakeholders.\n",

    "The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was to efficiently calculate the time taken by each personnel on their shifts in a warehouse management system.\n",
    "Data needed to be extracted from ShipHero API and processed to generate meaningful insights.\n",
    "There was a need for a web interface to provide user-friendly access to the data and allow for data filtering.\n",
    "There is a mapping issue in Python Script which occurred in December of 2022. Maybe due to the addition of another warehouse. This is an open issue and ShipHero is unable to provide any reliable solution for the same. [Issue has been highlighted below in the section of ‘’Known Issues’’]\n",

    "Our Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an API to Google BigQuery using a Python script deployed on Google Cloud.\n",

    "\n",
    "Solution Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution involved two main components: a Python script and a web interface (Web App).\n",
    "The Python script utilized ShipHero API to fetch data and calculate personnel shift times. It then stored the processed data in Google BigQuery.\n",
    "The web interface allowed users to log in, apply filters to data tables fetched from BigQuery, and visualize the data.\n",
